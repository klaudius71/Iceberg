# Iceberg
A basic little framework for making Vulkan apps.

This will serve as the backbone for a future ray-tracing research project.

NOTE: The Vulkan path is defined in the project through the VULKAN_SDK macro. 
If you do not have the Vulkan SDK installed, run the generate script with the "volk" suffix.
